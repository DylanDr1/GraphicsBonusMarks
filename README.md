# Shaders

Toon Shader 

For the toon shader we decided to use it on the floor of the ring and to the models we used in the scene. This allowed for the game to have more of a cartoony look to it, which is similar to what future punch out games had. The game also is unlike most boxing games, instead of wanting to be realistic and having the best graphics and details possible, it goes for more of a simplistic style, which is similar to what other games that use toon shader want to accomplish.

Bump map shader

For the next application of the shader, we decided to go for a bump map shader on the side ropes of the arena. This would allow for the ropes to have a more detailed texture and look for it which is something that we would like to achieve in the updated scene. Going for a rough look with presence of depth.

# Post Processing/Visual Effects

For post processing we chose to implement the wave effect used on the water texture, but instead applied it to a texture of an audience to simulate cheering. We chose this because a live audience can often act like a wave because of how passionate people get with sports. Sometimes there are actual “waves” that the audience performs as a fun ritual/practice. On the coding side of things, unlike the standard shader, the wave moves along the Z axis to give the illusion of jumping up and down, instead of moving left and right.
